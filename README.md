## Instructor's Note :

All the code typed in the course lectures is in the <strong>src</strong> folder shown above. 
Please <strong>don't</strong> just download or copy this code. I'd like you to be creating this project from scratch as I show you in the lectures step by step. You'll learn a bazillion times more effectively that way, I promise. This code is just for your reference in case you want to double-check the code you typed with what I typed in the video.

## About the course :

Why Spring?
- Spring is, by far, the most popular framework for application development in the Java ecosystem. Nothing else even comes close. Why? Because it makes software development so much easier in Java.
- You can build webapps, mobile apps, desktop apps, batch and big data apps and services in a record time using Spring.
- Spring does a lot of things right, and it's getting better and better with each release. There aren't a lot of technologies with the kind of wide reach, stability and maturity of Spring, that still move fast and innovate. That's a really tough balance to hit, and Spring has been a leader in that space for over a decade.
- Today, Spring, along with Boot, is a polished, modern and highly expressive framework that makes building apps like twitter almost trivial (easily passes the twitter test). So, the popularity of the Spring ecosystem is well deserved.
- If you're working in Java, you're very likely doing work with Spring because 90% of all Java projects use Spring!
- This course will prepare you to become an expert on the Spring Framework. Together, we will build an industry standard Spring Web Application which will transition you from a beginner to an experienced and employable Spring Developer.
- We will build a real world application in which we will cover topics and practices that are used throughout the industry.
- You will type every line of code along with me, as we explain in the tutorials, to ensure that you fully comprehend the subject matter.
- We will be available to answer any questions that you may have, so you will never be stuck on a section, or have confused on any topic.
